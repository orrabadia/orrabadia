### Interests
> It's always good to be multi-dimensional!
- Education --- Increasing equity and access in computer science by reaching out and education those who don't have access to proper resources.
- AI Automation --- Using LLMs to automate daily and time-consuming tasks, and freeing up time to focus on what matters!
- Biology --- I love learning about little microscopic compounds that play a huge role in the life we get to live.
- Economics --- There are so many factors and moving pieces that go into our economy, and I'm hungry to learn about them!
- Design --- Designing for marketing and accessibility is something I can always get behind.
- Music --- Producing and making music allows me to express my feelings into a form that others can dissect.
