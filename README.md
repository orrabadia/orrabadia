## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
> I'm Om Rabadia, a Bioinformatics student at UC San Diego who enjoys giving back to the community by providing opportunities I didn't have access to and bridging gaps within younger generations that can hinder success.

### Interests
> It's always good to be multi-dimensional!
- Education --- Increasing equity and access in computer science by reaching out and education those who don't have access to proper resources.
- Biology --- I love learning about little microscopic compounds that play a huge role in the life we get to live.
- Economics --- There are so many factors and moving pieces that go into our economy, and I'm hungry to learn about them!
- Design --- Designing for a good cause is something I always can get behind. It also allows me to express my self creatively.
- Music --- Producing and making music allows me to express my feelings into a form that others can dissect.

### My Toolkit
